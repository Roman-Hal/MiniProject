      <h3>Biggest Source of Renewable Energy in the UK</h3>
      <p>Offshore and onshore wind is the biggest source of renewable energy in the UK. It not only beats the other renewable sources by 13.8% of total electricity generation in the UK, it also beats the combined generation of coal, oil, and others by 6.5%. The best area in the UK in terms of renewable energy generation is Scotland. Simultaneous with the growth of renewable energy, the use of coal for electricity has continued to decline. From consuming 57,438,000 tonnes in 2006, to only 12,058,000 tonnes in 2016.
      <br></br><br></br>The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) released a number of reports on the 22nd of February detailing the energy production of 2017 Q3. The report shows the steady growth of renewable energy in the United Kingdom. In 2009, the electricity generation from renewable energy sources was 25,244 GWh. Since then it has grown by 230%, and, in 2016, the total electricity generated was 83,255 GWh. The growth does not seem to be slowing down. In fact, 2017 looks to have been better than ever!

      <h4> Growth of Solar Power in the UK</h4>
      <p> Solar power has made an inspiring journey in the UK over the past nine years, from generating merely 20 GWh in 2009 to 10,420 GWh in 2016. Solar PV has already generated 10,025 GWh in the first three quarters of 2017, which made up 4.2% of United Kingdom's total electricity generation. The growth of solar energy usage will most likely continue in the future as we are constantly installing more Solar PV in the UK.<br></br> 2020 was the UK’s highest year on record for renewable generation so far, and we’ve been breaking records for renewables ever since. 50% in 2021. In contrast, power provided from fossil fuels was down to roughly 35% in 2021 compared with over 75% in 2010. In 2020 renewables accounted for more than 43.1% of the UK's total electricity generated, at 312 terawatt hours (TWh). This outstripped fossil fuels over the course of a year, for the first time in the nation’s history.  This is the longest coal-free period since the industrial revolution, which began in the mid-1700s! Zero-carbon generation overtook fossil fuel consumption in 11 months of the year in 2021. 2021 was the second highest year for renewable generation on record, after 2020.  </p>
